  <h3 style="color: white">&nbsp;This is Anum Ahmad's (aqa2001) interpretation of the clock assignment. I hope you enjoy!</h3>
  <h6 style="color: white"> This clock uses a spiral, where the distance from the center corresponds with the minimum and maximum values for the time. <br>
    Additionally, the saturation is ordered from the smallest unit (seconds) having the lowest saturation to the largest unit (hours) having the largest saturation. <br>
  The angles also match those of a clock face to help with telling the time to the closest quarter.</h6>
